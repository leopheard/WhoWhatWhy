<a href="kodi.tv">KODI<a> / XBMC / Firestick addon for the <a href="https://whowhatwhy.org/">WhoWhatWhy</a> podcast.<br>

My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/RealRussBaker">Russ Baker</a>. For more than two decades I have been an investigative journalist, doing what I believed journalists were supposed to do — seek the truth and publish nothing less. Over the years, however, I have learned how the media gatekeepers, both “mainstream” and “alternative,” will not allow the biggest, most disturbing revelations to see the light of day.<br>

I started <a href="https://whowhatwhy.org/">WhoWhatWhy</a> because I was tired of the cynicism, self-interest, and cowardice that I witnessed in the news media. I started WhoWhatWhy to show how good — and how consequential — journalism can be when the only mandate is to dig relentlessly and reveal, without exception, what we uncover.<br>
